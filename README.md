# C# 2D Card Game (WPF)

Minimal scaffold for a 2D card game using WPF and .NET.

Try it (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd Un
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Un.csproj
```

This prototype shows a window with a "Draw Card" button to display a random card.

UN deck

The project now uses an UN deck with 108 cards generated by the game engine:

- 19 red cards: one 0 and two each of 1-9
- 19 blue cards: one 0 and two each of 1-9
- 19 green cards: one 0 and two each of 1-9
- 19 yellow cards: one 0 and two each of 1-9
- 2 Skip per color
- 2 Reverse per color
- 2 DrawTwo per color
